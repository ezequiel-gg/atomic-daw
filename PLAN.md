editing:
* rotation: swipe to lock points, instead of free precision 
* zoom to set levels (25/50/100/150/200%)

* use motion gestures like shaking the device away/towards you, up/down, side/side, rotate-left-right / rotate-right-left, different commands for different gesture speed thresholds too *quick left-right shake: undo, right-left: redo
